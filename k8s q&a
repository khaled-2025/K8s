Scenario Based Interview Questions:
=================================================
âœ¨ Scenario 01:

Your e-commerce application is experiencing a sudden surge in traffic during the holiday season. You need to quickly scale your application to handle the increased load without impacting performance.

How would you use Kubernetes to scale your application horizontally to handle the increased traffic?

ðŸ’¥ Answer:

To horizontally scale your application in Kubernetes, you can use the following approaches:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): HPA is a Kubernetes controller that automatically scales the number of pods in a Deployment or ReplicaSet based on CPU or memory usage. You can configure HPA to automatically scale up your application when CPU or memory usage exceeds a certain threshold.

Manual scaling: You can manually scale your application by editing the Deployment or ReplicaSet manifest file and increasing the number of replicas. This approach is less efficient than using HPA, as you need to manually monitor your application's metrics and adjust the number of replicas accordingly.
=================================================
âœ¨ Scenario 2:

Your microservices-based application is experiencing frequent pod restarts due to errors in one of the microservices. This is causing downtime for your application and impacting user experience.

How would you use Kubernetes to improve the resiliency of your application and reduce downtime caused by pod restarts?

ðŸ’¥ Answer:

To improve the resiliency of your application and reduce downtime caused by pod restarts, you can use the following approaches:

Liveness probes and readiness probes: Liveness probes are used to determine whether a container is healthy and should be restarted. Readiness probes are used to determine whether a container is ready to accept traffic. By configuring liveness and readiness probes, you can ensure that only healthy containers are restarted and that unhealthy containers are not exposed to traffic.

Init containers: Init containers are containers that run before the main application containers in a pod. They are typically used to perform tasks such as initializing configuration files or downloading data. By using init containers, you can ensure that your application is properly configured and has the necessary data before the main application containers start.

Sidecars: Sidecars are containers that are deployed alongside the main application containers in a pod. They typically provide additional functionality to the application, such as logging, monitoring, or health checks. By using sidecars, you can decouple these functionalities from the main application and make your application more resilient to failures.
=================================================
âœ¨ Scenario 3:

You are managing a large Kubernetes cluster with hundreds of nodes. You need to ensure that your cluster is secure and that unauthorized users cannot access your pods and services.

How would you use Kubernetes security features to protect your cluster from unauthorized access?

ðŸ’¥ Answer:

To protect your Kubernetes cluster from unauthorized access, you can use the following security features:

Role-based access control (RBAC): RBAC allows you to define fine-grained permissions for users and groups, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they need.

Network policies: Network policies allow you to control network traffic between pods and between pods and external services. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to your pods and services.

Pod security policies: Pod security policies allow you to restrict the capabilities of pods, such as preventing them from running as root or mounting host directories.

Secret management: Kubernetes provides a built-in secret management system that allows you to store sensitive information, such as passwords and tokens, securely.

By implementing these security features, you can make your Kubernetes cluster more secure and protect your pods and services from unauthorized access.
